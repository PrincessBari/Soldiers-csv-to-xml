# Soldiers-csv-to-xml

# OBJECTIVE:
The point of this exercise was to take a list of soldiers, found
in the attached file mss_soldiers.csv, and convert it to xml. We had
to take a look at the file and think about how to structure the xml
because not all rows had the same information. For example, some soldiers
(though not many) had a secondary name, and a few had an additional
comment made about them in one of the columns
